# Retail Supply Chain Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the retail supply chain by cleaning and preprocessing data in Python using Jupyter Notebook and then visualizing key insights using Looker Studio.

## Workflow

1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Jupyter Notebook)

Loaded the raw dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Handled missing values by filling or dropping them where necessary.

Converted data types for consistency (e.g., date formatting, numerical conversions).

Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

Created new calculated fields where necessary (e.g., total revenue, discount percentages).

Exported the cleaned dataset for visualization in Looker Studio.

2.Dashboard Creation (Looker Studio)

Imported the cleaned dataset into Looker Studio.

Created various charts to visualize different aspects of the supply chain:

Sales Performance Analysis: Line chart showing trends over time.

Inventory Management: Highlighted low-stock items using conditional formatting.

Pricing & Discount Analysis: Scatter plots with trendlines for insights.

Logistics & Delivery Performance: Impact of weather conditions on sales.

Applied interactive filters to allow dynamic data exploration.

Finalized the dashboard with styling and formatting for better readability.

## Key Features of the Dashboard

Interactive Filters: Users can toggle between different conditions (e.g., weather, product category, stock levels).

Conditional Formatting: Highlights low-stock items to improve inventory management.

Trend Analysis: Trendlines applied to visualize sales patterns over time.

Delivery Insights: Analyzed how external factors (e.g., weather) affect logistics and sales.

## Tools & Technologies Used

Jupyter Notebook (Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and preprocessing.

Looker Studio for data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Next Steps

Automate data updates to keep the dashboard dynamic.

Integrate real-time data sources for live tracking of inventory and sales.

Enhance predictive analytics for better demand forecasting.

## How to Use

Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Retail Supply Chain.ipynb) to review the data cleaning steps.

Load the cleaned dataset into Looker Studio.

Explore the interactive dashboard to analyze sales trends, inventory levels, and logistics performance.
