# 🚀 Retail Supply Chain Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the retail supply chain by cleaning and preprocessing data in Python using Jupyter Notebook 🐍 and then visualizing key insights using Looker Studio 📊.

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1.🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Jupyter Notebook)

📥 Loaded the raw dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

🛠 Handled missing values by filling or dropping them where necessary.

🔄 Converted data types for consistency (e.g., date formatting, numerical conversions).

❌ Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

📊 Created new calculated fields where necessary (e.g., total revenue, discount percentages).

📤 Exported the cleaned dataset for visualization in Looker Studio.

### 2.📊 Dashboard Creation (Looker Studio)

🔗 Imported the cleaned dataset into Looker Studio.

📈 Created various charts to visualize different aspects of the supply chain:

📉 Sales Performance Analysis: Line chart showing trends over time.

📦 Inventory Management: Highlighted low-stock items using conditional formatting.

💰 Pricing & Discount Analysis: Scatter plots with trendlines for insights.

🚚 Logistics & Delivery Performance: Impact of weather conditions on sales.

🎛 Applied interactive filters to allow dynamic data exploration.

🎨 Finalized the dashboard with styling and formatting for better readability.

## ⭐ Key Features of the Dashboard

🎛 Interactive Filters: Users can toggle between different conditions (e.g., weather, product category, stock levels).

🔴🟢 Conditional Formatting: Highlights low-stock items to improve inventory management.

📈 Trend Analysis: Trendlines applied to visualize sales patterns over time.

🚀 Delivery Insights: Analyzed how external factors (e.g., weather) affect logistics and sales.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Jupyter Notebook (Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and preprocessing.

Looker Studio for data visualization and dashboard creation.

## 🔜 Next Steps

🔄 Automate data updates to keep the dashboard dynamic.

📡 Integrate real-time data sources for live tracking of inventory and sales.

📊 Enhance predictive analytics for better demand forecasting.

## 🏁 How to Use

📜 Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Retail Supply Chain.ipynb) to review the data cleaning steps.

📂 Load the cleaned dataset into Looker Studio.

🔍 Explore the interactive dashboard to analyze sales trends, inventory levels, and logistics performance.
